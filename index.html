                    <p class="item-description">Including the property lines on your development site plan is one of the most important elements. In a way, it sets the stage for your design. You can have the most innovative or beautiful building, but you cant encroach on an owners adjacent property. If you do, you will be in for extra time conducting more surveys and more drawings. At worst, you could find yourself with a lawsuit. </p>

                    <p class="item-description">Understanding your site goes beyond staying inside your own property lines. Surrounding infrastructure and buildings play an important role in shaping your design. Make sure to include all those dimensions on your plan because issues like the following are determined by what goes on around the site</p>
                </div>
                <div class="bonus-item">
                    <h3 class="item-title">Existing and Proposed Conditions</h3>
                    <p class="item-description">For city officials and plan reviewers to grasp the full scope of your design, you will want to present both existing and proposed conditions, including fence lines and especially all utility lines. It also lets you know if other city officials such as inspectors need to be present throughout the construction of your building.

                    <h3 class="item-title">Easements</h3>
                    <p class="item-description">Easements are needed anytime you need to cross or maintain an element of your design that will exist on an adjacent property. For example, if you need a pipe run and it crosses the corner of another property, you need an easement to have the legal right to cross that corner and maintain that portion of the pipe. You can show easements graphically or with text, but there needs to be no question that an easement exists.
